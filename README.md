# Driver for 7 segment displays

A simple code written in `microC` for driving **Microchop's PIC micro-controller** to display numbers on multiple 7-segment displays.

The displays are connected paralelly on the same port to reduce wiring and preserve ports. They are refreshed alternately at regular intervals. 

_Q: Psst.. That's cool and all. But what the hell is a 7-segment display?_\
_A: Ever seen an action movie with a time bomb? The timer thingy on the bomb is a 7 segment display._
